# What to expect while coding

1. Perfect candidates are awesome, but rare
2. Interviewer just wants to make sur eyou're a good coder
3. Pick the language you're most comfortable with
4. Talk out loud. Show your interviewer your thought process

# Signal, not perfection

What makes a good code?

- Readability
- Correctness
- Performance
- Maintainability
... and so on

**Wait until you're ready to code!**

**& wait until your interviewer is ready**

"I understand the basic gist of what I'm going to write" is not good enough

If you get confused while coding, don't power through. Go back to your example / your algorithm and figure out what you need to do

You should know things like:
- Your input/output data types
- Index math
- Helper functions
- Data structures and when they change

# Coding: tips and tricks

Don't just dive in. Make sure you know the little details. Wait until you and your interviewer are ready

Demonstrate that you're a great coder:
- Correctness
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Performance

Use the neat features of your programming language
- Ask if you're not sure
- Can often "make up" reasonable functions (or assume at first and implement later)
- Use good style
- Think about error cases, boundary checks, etc.

# Writing structured code

Structuring your code makes it more readable, maintainable, etc AND makes your life easier

Modularize code top down, filling in the next most interesting piece of code

Ignore things that don't show good signal (but check with your interviewer first)
- Almost like you're pretending you have functions built in

**Focus on what shows signal**
