# The seven steps

1. Listen...for clues
2. Draw an example: large and generic
3. Brute force
4. Optimize
5. Walk through algorithm
6. Code
7. Verification

# Optimizing with BUD

- Bottlenecks
- Unnecessary work
- Duplicated work

# Optimizing with space and time

1. Hash tables
2. Pre-computation
3. Tries

## Best conceivable runtime (B.C.R)

Given the nature of the problem, what is the best runtime you could possibly imagine getting? What runtime could you clearly not beat?

B.C.R. is not necessarily achievable...it's just not beatable

# Optimizing with DIY

1. Come up with a good example (large & generic), then figure out the output

2. "Reverse engineer" your intuitive thought process
3. Pay atention to any short circuiting or tricks you use
