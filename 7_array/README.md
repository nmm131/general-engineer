# Tips and tricks

## Tactical things
- 2D arrays, creation, indexing, etc. Matrices or lists of lists?
- Sorting
- Get min & max
- Partitioning, merging, slicing
- List comprehensions, lambda, reduce, map, filter, etc.

## Common bugs
- Off by 1 errors. Boundary. Indexing
- Test again 1 and 2 element arrays
- Time complexity of built-in array functions
- 2D arrays, use row, column (not x,y)

## Common patterns and concepts
- Insert at end
- Index math. Two pointers, swapping
- In-place? Okay to modify input?

## Extras
- Working with subarrays and matrices
- Fixed length -> resizable arrays
- Hash tables
